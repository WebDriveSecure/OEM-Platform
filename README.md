## Problem
Modern cars are rapidly embracing autonomous and eco-friendly functionalities like adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and complete autonomous driving. The <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/01/8-ways-ai-can-help-save-the-planet/">World Economic Forum</a> recognizes that implementing route optimizations, eco-driving algorithms, and introducing autonomous driving ride-share services can play a significant role in curbing greenhouse gas emissions and protecting the environment. However, the advent of these advanced technologies also expands the potential attack surface for cyber attackers to exploit. Of particular concern is the vulnerability during the software/firmware update process, which often becomes a prime target for cyber attacks. As the prevalence of autonomous features grows, the frequency of updates aimed at enhancing and securing these systems will inevitably increase.
